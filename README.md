#Here you can find a compact box enclosure for the OCTOPRINT application using RaspberryPi 3A.
The camera is mounted on an adjustable support that allows to orient it for 360 degrees. 
This small box can be supported with a commercial cheap flexible clamp normally used for smartphone 
all the components are mounted on a plate that grants easy removal and maintenance.
The construction involves the use of a GEWISS 44205 box, easily available from your local supplier or on AMAZON eBay ...
In this case, is enough to make the plate and  the support 3D printout 
The camera support have to be fixed using a couple of little screws
By printing the PDF file you can cut out the shapes of the holes that you can glue on the respective faces with a removable glue, and this will facilitate your drilling work.
For those who cannot find the box, they can print it directly from the file with the advantage that the holes are already foreseen during printing.
I used this to light and support the OCTOPRINT box:https://www.amazon.it/gp/product/B085VRYGB9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_image_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
